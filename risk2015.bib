abstract = {Offshoring is a widely used practice in the software development. It is mainly employed to reduce development costs. However, as in a number of studies have been shown, about 40 percent of offshore software development projects are flops. One predominant reason for it is the lack of standardized and practicable methods of risk management due to the inherent complexity of software development offshoring. Therefore, suitable methods and tools for the risk management specific to such projects are required. Firstly, this workshop will provide an insight into various aspects of the risk management of offshore software development. Secondly, tools and methods for the risk management will be discussed and presented. Thirdly, priorities for further research will be identified. The results of this workshop will, on the one hand, benefit companies sharing in the software development offshoring and, on the other hand, academics to identify the demand in the furher reseach.

abstract = {The aim of this research paper is to study risk management system and to find some tools and techniques recommended by different journals and articles. We have gone through different approaches in context of risk management. We have taken risk management paradigm introduced by Software Engineering Institute as our standard to analyze different techniques and tools. Different features have been mined out from those models and trying to show shortcoming as well as asset qualities of those. Our approach is to find out best or suitable tools for software risk management in software development industries.},

@article{Stoneburner2002,
abstract = {Every organization has a mission. In this digital era, as organizations use automated information technology (IT) systems1 to process their information for better support of their missions, risk management plays a critical role in protecting an organizations information assets, and therefore its mission, from IT-related risk. An effective risk management process is an important component of a successful IT security program. The principal goal of an organizations risk management process should be to protect the organization and its ability to perform their mission, not just its IT assets. Therefore, the risk management process should not be treated primarily as a technical function carried out by the IT experts who operate and manage the IT system, but as an essential management function of the organization.},
